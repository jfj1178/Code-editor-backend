# Backend Server - IDE

**Deployment Strategy:**

1.  **Backend (Render):**
    * Render is well-suited for deploying containerized applications (like your Node.js backend with Docker).
    * **Docker Deployment:**
        * Create a Dockerfile that defines your backend environment.
        * Push your Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry).
        * Configure a Render Web Service to pull and run your Docker image.
        * Set environment variables in Render for your backend (e.g., database connection strings, API keys).
        * Configure Render's port settings to expose your backend API.
    * **Persistent Storage:**
        * Render offers persistent disks that you can mount to your Docker container to store user files.
        * Alternatively, you can use a cloud storage solution such as AWS S3, or Google Cloud Storage, and have the backend interact with that.
    * **Database:**
        * Render also provides managed databases (PostgreSQL) that you can connect to your backend.
        * Or, you can use any cloud based database.
